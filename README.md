# Jittor Large Scale Unsupervised Semantic Segmentation (PASS + SAM)
	
## Introduction

Baseline:PASS, containing four steps. 1) A randomly initialized model is trained with self-supervision of pretext tasksã€‚ 2) A pixel-attention-based clustering scheme to obtain pseudo categories and assign generated categories to each image pixel. 3) Fine-tune the pre-trained model with the generated pseudo labels to improve the segmentation quality. 4) During inference, the LUSS model assigns generated labels to each pixel of images, same to the supervised model. 

This repo provides four solutions to improve mIoU score based on PASS model and Segment Anything Model.

Results in th first line comes from PASS baseline. After improvement, object localization is more accurate and multiple objects can be detected.
